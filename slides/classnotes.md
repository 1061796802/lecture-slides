# An ordinary slide

With some text.

## And a block

And some text underneath.

\note{
Here are my notes.
}

# Another slide

- With a
- list.

\note{
A note on my list.
}

# A slide to show overlay tricks

This text appears on the first and third versions of the slide, but not the second.

This uses beamer's highlighting command to \alert{draw attention here}, but only on the second slide.

\note{
Notes can also have overlay specs. First slide version note.

Second.

}

\note{
And third. Use \LaTeX\ macros in notes, like \emph{emphasis}.

}

\note{
To get overlay effects with materials placed using \texttt{textpos}, you have to specify the overlay within the \texttt{textblock} environment.
