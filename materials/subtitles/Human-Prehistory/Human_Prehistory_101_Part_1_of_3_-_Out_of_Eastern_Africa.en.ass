Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.00,0:00:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Homo sapiens lived throughout Africa,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.00,0:00:24.36,Default,,0,0,0,,but only some of these people were our ancestors.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.00,0:00:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,By 60,000 years ago, our ancestors were on the move,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.00,0:00:43.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and their expansions started to have staying power,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.00,0:00:47.00,Default,,0,0,0,,we don't know how fast, or how far they traveled.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.00,0:00:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Today, hunter-gatherer groups move, on average, about 1 km a year,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.00,0:00:55.00,Default,,0,0,0,,it's about half mile.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.00,0:01:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,But it's not always consistent--what we do know is this,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.00,0:01:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,as their descendants moved into new environments,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.00,0:01:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,they became more isolated from one another,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.00,0:01:13.00,Default,,0,0,0,,setting the stage for the high level of genetic diversity

Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.00,0:01:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,By 50,000 years ago, people started making more sophisticated tools,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.00,0:01:37.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Did new language abilities spark this burst of innovation?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.00,0:01:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe a genetic change in a population allowed some people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.00,0:01:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,to express more complex concepts through language,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.00,0:01:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and so to out-compete those who couldn't,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.00,0:01:59.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Around 50,000 years ago, small groups of travelers crossed into Asia,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.00,0:02:29.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and the Sahara desert expanded, making it harder to turn back,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.00,0:02:35.00,Default,,0,0,0,,the intrepid travelers and their descendants followed a coastal route, eastward in Asia,

Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.00,0:02:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Did they meet Homo erectus along the way?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.00,0:02:58.00,Default,,0,0,0,,By 45,000 years ago, people were living in parts of Australia and making their mark.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.00,0:03:08.00,Default,,0,0,0,,In order to get there, they had to cross the 90 km--that's about 50 miles--of open water
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.00,0:03:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which separates Australia from the nearest islands of present-day Indonesia.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.00,0:03:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Just how this was done, no one knows.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.00,0:03:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,It's amazing to think that people reached Australia and Europe

Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.00,0:04:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,The Neanderthals were stocky, and physically better adapted to the cold climates,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.00,0:04:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but the newcomers proved to be very skilled

Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.00,0:04:23.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Though the Neanderthals may have acquired some of their neighbors' advanced technologies,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.00,0:04:26.92,Default,,0,0,0,,they soon found it hard to keep up.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.00,0:04:40.00,Default,,0,0,0,,The two populations coexisted, even interbred, for a few millenium,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.00,0:04:47.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but by 35,000 years ago, Neanderthals were confined
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.00,0:04:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,to the southwest corner of Europe, and soon thereafter, they had disappeared,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.00,0:05:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,another unsolved mystery, yes, our story is full of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.00,0:05:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Homo sapiens outlasted their cousins, and expanded their reach
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.00,0:05:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,across Africa, Eurasia, and Australia;
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.00,0:05:19.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but soon times got tough for everyone,
